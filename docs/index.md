# Introduction

In a not distant future, most of your activities will be done with the assistance, or completely autonomously, by your personal AI agent.
At Tesseract, we believe that AI agents will automate many jobs and tedious tasks, leaving humans with the most challenging problems and creating human-machine collaboration in many fields. We not only dream such a future, we're building it: Tesseract has build it the first **agent-ready payment protocol** with **0 seconds** of protocol-induced latency: [z402](/docs/z402/introduction.md), meaning that you don't need to wait a fraction of a second more if you use our payment protocol compared to not using any payment protocol at all.

A payment protocol for AI agents is a fundamental building block for what will be the **Internet of Agents**, a set of AI effectively collaborating with each other solving complex real world tasks. Tesseract offers open source tools and commercial solutions to future proof your products and projects and get you ready for the **Agentic commerce**.

If you want to know more, we suggest you to read our [introductory blog post](/blog/what-is-the-internet-of-agents) on the Internet of Agents.
