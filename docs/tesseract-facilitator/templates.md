# Ideas and Templates

Here are some ideas for you to hack on if you needed some inspiration! You can find for each idea a GitHub template repo to get you started.

- **AI character on X (Twitter)**: build a personality and give it life with an LLM, then let their fans tip it using z402
- **AI agent on telegram**: build a useful AI agent on Telegram, your agent can get paid using the TON network and pay other agents in the same way!
- **Pay per content business model**: are you an exclusive creator? You can monetize your content by asking for a micropayment every time someone wants to get access to a picture, video, blog post or any of your content.
