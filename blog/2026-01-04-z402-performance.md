<!-- TODO: write "An honest and complete ..." when you complete it... -->

An honest review of the costs and scalability of z402.

<!-- truncate -->

## Scope

In this article, we will analyze the costs and scalability of the two operative modes of z402: x-mode (equivalent to x402) and z-mode.

We will evaluate the costs in terms of gas of an EVM compatible blockchain and in some currencies, while the scalability will be measured in terms of gas and TPS relative to some blockchains.

In both cases we will compare the results with x402.
